#PART 2: WE MARCH AGAINST THE RED AND GOLD
#SCENARIO 5: Betrayal / Lavinium Falls (950 SI, August)
#	The supplies of the Lavinians burned, the Marauder victory is assured. The mood in your camp is high. In discussion with Harn and Ranhilde, however, it comes out how the marriage between you and her actually came about. Enraged, you send both of them back to Marauderdom - the best punishment that can be inflicted on them is to not let them have a part in your victory over the Lavinians.
#	You have seiged the city for almost five years. Now, finally, their food supplies exhausted, the Lavinians open their gates and try to drive you away. With the gates open, you must seize the opportunity; you must force your way within the city walls, take the palace, and behead the Emperor Quirinius Maximus.
