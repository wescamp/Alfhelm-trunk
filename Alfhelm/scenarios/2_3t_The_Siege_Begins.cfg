#PART 2: WE MARCH AGAINST THE RED AND GOLD
#SCENARIO 3t: The Siege Begins (946 SI, May)
#	You continue south, towards Lavinium. In two years time, you reach the city itself. You have never seen anything like it. The walls are a hundred feet high, and made of solid stone. The only entrance is through the gates, made of iron and impenetrable when sealed, and through the river, which runs through the city. You cannot take it by force alone. You decide to seige it. The Lavinians are not stupid; when they see you approach across the plains, they close the gates of the city and refuse to give battle.
