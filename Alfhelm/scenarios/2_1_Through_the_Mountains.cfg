#PART 2: WE MARCH AGAINST THE RED AND GOLD
#SCENARIO 1: Through the Mountains (943 SI, April)
#	Your route brings you south, where you must go through the Mountains of Arendia. Thence you will go through Arendia, to the vast plains of Ceresia, then on to conquer Lavinia. But in these mountains of Arendia, a band of orcs attacks you, seeking revenge for your defeat of them five years ago.
