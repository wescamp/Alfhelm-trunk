#PART 3: THE DARK DEPTHS OF THE FOREST
#SCENARIO 3: Unexpected Aid (952 SI, February-March)
#Just before the spring thaw, help arrives unexpectedly from the North. The Frost Elves, who refused to aid you against Lavinium, are all too happy to fight against the Sidhe. They bring boats, and offer to take you up along the Silvian coastline to the Sidhe lands. Their boats can move in the ice, and you will get there before anyone else is able to move troops. You accept. The travel along the coast is no problem. The difficulty comes when the Sidhe see you attempting to land, and try to stop you.
