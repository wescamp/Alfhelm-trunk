#PART 2: WE MARCH AGAINST THE RED AND GOLD
#SCENARIO 3: Ceresia (944 SI, May)
#	After passing through Arendia, you enter Ceresia across the Arendia River. After pillaging for some time, both in support of your army and for sport, you encounter a true Lavinian-style city, surrounded by stone walls. It is already besieged by a different group of Marauders - there are many of them roaming the lands of Lavinia. This other group, assuming you are going to attack them, torches the wheatfields of Ceresia to prevent your approach. You must capture the town and force this other group of Marauders to join you.
